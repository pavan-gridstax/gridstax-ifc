It is issued by India Post and is especially favored by conservative investors for fixed, guaranteed growth.[^12][^13][^14][^15]"},{"type":"markdown","title":"How the Scheme Works","body":"- Investor purchases NSC certificates (now in e-mode) for a lock-in of 5 years.\n- The interest is compounded annually (currently **7.7% p.a.** for 2025) and paid out only at maturity.\n- Minimum deposit: ₹1,000; no maximum investment limit.\n- Investment amount and accrued interest are paid in a lump sum at maturity.\n- Interest for the first 4 years is eligible for tax rebate as it is considered reinvested.[^15][^16][^17]"},{"type":"markdown","title":"Eligibility Criteria","body":"- Any **resident individual** can invest.\n- NRIs, HUFs, and trusts not permitted (exception: Karta in personal capacity).\n- Accounts may be held individually (including minors via guardian) or jointly (up to 3 adults).[^16][^17][^18][^15]"},{"type":"markdown","title":"How to Apply","body":"- Visit any India Post branch.\n- Fill out the NSC application form and submit KYC proofs (Aadhaar, PAN, address).\n- Pay the investment amount via cash, cheque, or e-transfer.\n- Nomination facility available.\n- E-certificates are now standard (physical certificates discontinued since 2016).[^13][^19][^14]"},{"type":"markdown","title":"Important Points to Note","body":"- Tax benefit under Section 80C up to ₹1.5 lakh invested per year.\n- Interest is taxable but eligible for deduction for the first four years.\n- Certificates can be pledged as loan collateral.\n- No premature withdrawal, except in specific cases (death of holder, court order).\n- Transferable between post offices and persons (once during tenure).[^14][^20][^15]"},{"type":"markdown","title":"Useful Links","body":"- Official Post
