Works","body":"- Eligible individuals deposit a lump sum (minimum ₹1,000; maximum ₹30 lakh) in the scheme via a post office or authorized bank.\n- The prevailing interest rate (currently 8.2% per annum for Q2 FY 2025-26) is paid out quarterly and remains fixed for the deposit tenure.\n- The scheme has a tenure of 5 years, extendable once by 3 years after maturity.\n- Premature withdrawals are allowed with penalties.\n- Interest is taxable, though deductible up to ₹1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act (old regime).[^5][^6][^3][^7]"},{"type":"markdown","title":"Eligibility
