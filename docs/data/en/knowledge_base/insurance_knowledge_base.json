{"meta":{"version":"2.0","last_updated":"2026-01-12","region":"IN","description":"Comprehensive guide to Term Life, Health Insurance, and ULIPs covering hidden clauses, claim settlement nuances, and agent tactics."},"term_insurance_knowledge":{"title":"Term Insurance: The Unspoken Rules","claim_decoder":[{"id":"term_csr_vs_asr","name":"Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) is Misleading","rule":"Look at Amount Settlement Ratio (ASR)","insight":"CSR counts *number* of claims. A company can pay 99 small claims and reject 1 big claim (yours), still showing 99% CSR. ASR measures the *value* of claims paid.","action":"Check the 'Amount Settlement Ratio' in the IRDAI Annual Report. If CSR is 99% but ASR is 85%, they are rejecting high-value claims."},{"id":"term_section_45","name":"Section 45 (The 3-Year Ironclad Rule)","rule":"Incontestable after 3 years","insight":"Per Insurance Act Section 45, if a policy is in force for 3 years, the insurer CANNOT reject a claim for any reason—not even for fraud or non-disclosure of medical history. It becomes indisputable.","action":"Survive the first 3 years! Pay premiums on time. Do not let the policy lapse, or the 3-year clock resets."},{"id":"term_mwpa","name":"MWP Act (Married Women's Property Act)","rule":"Bulletproof Creditor Protection","insight":"If you buy a policy under MWP Act, the claim amount belongs *exclusively* to the wife and children (trustees). Even if you have huge business debts, loans, or go bankrupt, courts/banks CANNOT touch this money.","action":"Crucial for business owners and home loan borrowers. Tick 'Yes' for MWP Act in the proposal form (cannot be done later)."}],"rider_check":[{"id":"term_ci_rider","term":"Critical Illness Rider vs Standalone","warning":"Definition Trap","reason":"Riders cover listed illnesses only at 'advanced stages' (e.g., Cancer of specified severity). A standalone plan often covers early stages and more diseases.","recommendation":"Avoid Riders if they increase premium significantly. Buy a comprehensive standalone Critical Illness plan."},{"id":"term_adb_rider","term":"Accidental Death Benefit (ADB)","warning":"The 'Accident' Definition","reason":"Insurers define 'Accident' strictly. If death occurs 180 days after the accident due to complications, they might deny the claim. Also, it doesn't cover disability.","recommendation":"A standalone Personal Accident policy covers 'Temporary/Permanent Disability' which is more important than just death benefit."}],"process_hacks":[{"id":"term_medical_test","name":"Always Demand a Medical Test","insight":"Agents might suggest 'Non-Medical' limits to speed up issuance. Refuse this. A policy issued *after* a medical test is much harder for the insurer to dispute later claiming 'pre-existing condition'.","action":"Voluntarily ask for a medical check-up even if the insurer says it's not required."}]},"health_insurance_knowledge":{"title":"Health Insurance: Hidden Deductibles","clause_decoder":[{"id":"health_room_rent_capping","name":"Room Rent Capping (The Silent Killer)","risk":"Proportionate Deduction","insight":"If your limit is ₹5,000/day and you pick a room of ₹10,000/day, the insurer doesn't just deduct ₹5,000. They apply 'Proportionate Deduction' to the ENTIRE bill (Doctor fees, OT charges, Nursing) because these are linked to room category.","action":"MANDATORY: Buy a policy with 'No Room Rent Capping' or 'Single Private Room' eligibility. Otherwise, you pay 50% of the entire bill."},{"id":"health_zone_premium","name":"Zone-Based Premiums","risk":"Co-pay on Treatment in Higher Zone","insight":"Premiums are cheaper in Tier-2/3 cities (Zone B/C). But if you buy a Zone B policy and get treated in Mumbai/Delhi (Zone A), the insurer imposes a 10-20% Co-pay.","action":"If you live in a small town but plan to go to a metro for major surgeries, buy a Zone A (Metro) policy by paying slightly extra."},{"id":"health_consumables","name":"Consumables Cover","risk":"Non-Payable Items (Gloves, PPE, Syringes)","insight":"Consumables can form 10-15% of a hospital bill (especially post-COVID). Standard policies exclude them.","action":"Ensure your policy has a 'Consumables Benefit' add-on or built-in feature."},{"id":"health_restoration","name":"Restoration / Refill Benefit","risk":"Partial vs Total Refill","insight":"Most plans restore sum insured only for *unrelated* illnesses. If you have a relapse of the *same* illness in the same year, the basic restoration won't pay.","action":"Look for 'Unlimited Restoration' that works for 'Same Person, Same Illness' as well."}],"super_topup_hack":{"title":"The Super Top-up Strategy","concept":"High Coverage at Dirt Cheap Rates","example":"Instead of a ₹20 Lakh Corporate/Retail plan costing ₹25k, buy a ₹5 Lakh Base Plan (₹8k) + ₹15 Lakh Super Top-up (₹3k). Total ₹11k.","mechanism":"Super Top-up covers ANY claim amount above the 'Deductible' (e.g., ₹5L). It looks at the *aggregate* claims in a year, unlike a standard Top-up which looks at *single* claim.","action":"Base Plan of ₹5L is sufficient for minor issues. Super Top-up takes care of major catastrophic events."},"ayush_treatment":{"title":"AYUSH & Modern Treatment Limits","insight":"Many policies cap Ayurveda/Homeopathy (AYUSH) at 10-20% of Sum Insured. Similarly, Robotic Surgeries or Cyber Knife treatments often have 'sub-limits'.","action":"Check the 'Sub-limits' column in the policy wording specifically for Modern Treatments."}},"ulip_knowledge":{"title":"ULIPs: The Wealth Destruction Trap","fee_decoder":[{"id":"ulip_allocation_charge","name":"Premium Allocation Charge","insight":"A percentage of your premium (2-5%) is deducted straight away before investment. In the first year, this is highest to pay distributor commissions.","action":"Direct Mutual Funds have 0% entry load. 100% of your money is invested."},{"id":"ulip_mortality_charge","name":"Mortality Charge (The Age Tax)","insight":"Insurers deduct units monthly to provide life cover. As you get older, mortality risk rises, so they sell MORE of your units to pay for insurance. This eats into compounding returns significantly in later years.","action":"Don't mix insurance with investment. Term Plan premiums are fixed for life. ULIP mortality charges rise with age."},{"id":"ulip_admin_charges","name":"Policy Admin Charges","insight":"A flat monthly fee deducted from your fund value, regardless of performance.","action":"Compare 'Reduction in Yield' (RIY). If RIY > 1.5%, the ULIP is expensive."}],"tax_reality":[{"id":"ulip_tax_2.5L","term":"The ₹2.5 Lakh Rule (Post-2021)","change":"Tax Free Haven Lost","insight":"If annual premium exceeds ₹2.5 Lakh, the maturity proceeds are TAXABLE as Capital Gains (12.5% LTCG) just like Mutual Funds. The 'Tax-Free' advantage is gone for HNI investors.","action":"Check the issuance date. Policies bought after Feb 1, 2021 fall under this rule."}]}}
